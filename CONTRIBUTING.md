# 2. Where to begin

- The first part of the project will be mostly Front-end Development(VueJS)
- Take a look at the [Project Board](https://github.com/mscraftsman/devcon2019/projects/1)
- It is likely there are open [issues](https://github.com/mscraftsman/devcon2019/issues) that you can help with.

# 3. How to contribute

1. [Pick an Issue](https://github.com/mscraftsman/devcon2019/issues) or Create an issue to help with
2. Comment on the issue and let everyone know you'll be helping on this. (to avoid duplicates)
3. Clone the `dev` branch and resolve the issue locally.
4. Make a merge request to the `dev` branch
5. One of the maintainers will review the PR and merge, else there will be comments if adjustments are required.

# 4. Deployment to Staging

We're using Netlify as a our 'continuous integration' thing during development.

Once a maintainer merges new changes in the branch `dev-deploy`, netlify will
automatically trigger a new build pipeline and after a few minutes the changes will be shown on the staging website.
