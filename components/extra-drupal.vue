                    <p>Drupal must be one of the most used PHP CMS in Mauritius and with the advent of Drupal 8, the
                        community just keeps growing. The lack of communication and local support for Drupal in
                        Mauritius gave rise to DrupalMauritius.</p>
                    <p>This newly minted user group will be about knowledge sharing, workshops and meetups around the
                        Drupal  framework. The kickoff of DrupalMauritius will be during the Developers Conference
                    </p>
