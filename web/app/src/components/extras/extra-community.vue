        Communication with your environment is an essential part of everyone's
        life. And it doesn't matter whether you are actually living in a rural
        area in the middle of nowhere, within the pulsating heart of a big city,
        or in my case on a wonderful island in the Indian Ocean. The ability to
        exchange your thoughts, your experience and your worries with another
        person helps you to get different points of view and new ideas on how to
        resolve an issue you might be confronted with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take the chance to exchange with other attendees in the reception area
        or on the balcony. Have some interesting conversations about software
        development, latest information gained during one of the presentations
        and let others know about your ups & downs in your projects.
      </p>

        Also, join the Mauritius Software Craftsmanship Community and be part of
        the local IT community.
