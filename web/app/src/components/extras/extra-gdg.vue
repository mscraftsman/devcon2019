          The GDG Mauritius is a local community-ran meetup for developers
          interested in resources and technology from Google Developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          GDGs are local groups of developers who are specifically interested in
          Google products and APIs. Each local group is called a GDG chapter and
          can host a variety of technical activities for developers - from just
          a few people getting together to watch our latest videos, to large
          gatherings with demos and tech talks, to hackathons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Disclaimer: GDG Mauritius is an independent user group; our activities
          and the opinions expressed here should in no way be linked to Google,
          the corporation.
