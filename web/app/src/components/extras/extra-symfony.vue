          Symfony<sup>mu</sup> is about passion and love of coding the right way
          in PHP with the help of the Symfony framework. To define the framework
          in its own words:
          <i
            >Symfony is a set of PHP Components, a Web Application framework, a
            Philosophy, and a Community â€” all working together in harmony.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently most PHP frameworks are using Symfony to pave their way to
          this new PHP 7 era and as the local community of Symfony, we are here
          to provide support to all developers in Mauritius who want to discover
          and adopt the Symfony way of coding. Please feel free to come to our
          Symfony talks and have a chat with us during the devcon. If you wish
          to know more about the framework, our philosophy and our community,
          please get in touch with us via our website:
